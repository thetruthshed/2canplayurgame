Sometimes just when you think you are one step ahead of the game, you'll find there is someone with more heart than you. Someone who has nothing to lose....except the constant thorn your inability to be the straight up man you pride yourelf in becoming from your high on the big white horses soap box! Oh how the mighty WILL fall and along with him-his famous demoraled Wench who loves to watch you come running over and over incapable of "movinon" always in begging position with your tail placed so promply between your so called legs....she will learn that the mockary he makes of her to all who'll listen is actually be the story her son tells long after she's gone when speaking to his therapist about the fucked up mother who made him who he is! The Karma Princess makes her own luck while 2r busy playing games, payback in high fashion....what a bitch!
